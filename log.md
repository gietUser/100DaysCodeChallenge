**Today's Progress**: Written 2 python program. Simlplest one though. Good start!!
1. Factorial of Number
2. Area of Cirlce

**Thoughts:** 
Learn 2 thing in python:
1. string formatting 
 ex: print("Factorial of {0} = {1}".format(num, res))
2. restricting decimal values in output print.
 ex: print("Area of the Circle: {0:.2f}".format(area))
